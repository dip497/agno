"""
Open Source Maintainer Intelligence Team

This team demonstrates the full power of Agno Teams by solving a real-world problem:
helping open source maintainers manage complex projects efficiently.

Team Composition:
- PR Review Council: Comprehensive code review expert
- Issue Triage Specialist: Intelligent issue categorization and prioritization
- Security Guardian: Security vulnerability detection and code safety
- Community Relations Manager: Contributor engagement and communication
- Release Coordinator: Release planning and changelog generation

Real-World Integration:
- Demo version uses mock data for self-contained testing
- Production version can integrate with real GitHub API via GithubTools
- Can be triggered by GitHub webhooks, CLI, or Agno OS chat interface
- Supports both interactive chat and automated workflows

Setup:
1. Ensure PostgreSQL is running: ./cookbook/scripts/run_pgvector.sh
2. Export API keys: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY
3. (Optional) Export GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN for real GitHub integration
4. Run via Agno OS: python cookbook/demo/run.py
5. Connect at os.agno.com to http://localhost:7777

GitHub Integration:
- Without GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN: Team analyzes based on text descriptions you provide
- With GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN: Team fetches real data from GitHub repositories

Usage Examples:
- "Review PR #342 in agno-agi/agno" (fetches real data if token provided)
- "Triage issue #156: Memory leak after 24 hours of operation"
- "Help respond to first-time contributor with code style issues"
- "Plan release v2.2.0 with breaking changes and security fixes"

# Agno Project Documentation

## Architecture
Agno is built on a modular architecture with three core components:
- Agents: Individual AI entities with specific roles and capabilities
- Teams: Coordinated groups of agents working together
- Workflows: Multi-step processes for complex tasks

## Code Standards
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Document all public APIs with docstrings
- Keep functions under 50 lines when possible

## Security Guidelines
- All user input must be validated and sanitized
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Store secrets in environment variables
- Regular dependency security audits

## Contribution Guidelines
- Fork and clone the repository
- Create feature branches from main
- Write tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Reference related issues in PR description
- Be respectful and constructive in all interactions

## Review Process
- PRs require approval from at least one maintainer
- Security changes require security team review
- Breaking changes need documentation updates
- Large PRs should be broken into smaller chunks
""",
            """
# Common Security Vulnerabilities

## SQL Injection
- Always use parameterized queries
- Never concatenate user input into SQL strings
- Use ORM query builders when possible

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Sanitize all user-provided HTML
- Use Content Security Policy headers
- Escape output in templates

## Authentication Issues
- Implement rate limiting on login endpoints
- Use strong password hashing (bcrypt, argon2)
- Require multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations
- Implement secure session management

## CSRF Protection
- Use CSRF tokens on all state-changing operations
- Implement SameSite cookie attributes
- Validate origin headers

## Dependency Security
- Regularly update dependencies
- Use tools like Safety, Snyk for vulnerability scanning
- Pin dependency versions for reproducibility
