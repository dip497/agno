Example demonstrating how to use pre_hook for comprehensive input validation with Agno Teams.

This example shows how to validate inputs specifically for team-based scenarios:
1. Validate input is appropriate for team collaboration
2. Check if the request can benefit from multiple perspectives
3. Ensure sufficient detail for team coordination

Note: The "Message" panel will be updated with validation results after the pre-hook is executed.
