"""
Example demonstrating how to use PII detection guardrails with Agno Agent.

This example shows how to:
1. Detect and block personally identifiable information (PII) in input
2. Protect sensitive data like SSNs, credit cards, emails, and phone numbers
3. Handle different types of PII violations with appropriate error messages
